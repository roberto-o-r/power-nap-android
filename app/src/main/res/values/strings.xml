    <string name="app_name">Power Nap</string>
    <string name="start_title">Need for Power?</string>
    <string name="start_nap_button">NAP!</string>
    <string name="start_description">A power nap will boost your memory, cognitive skills, creativity, and energy level.</string>
    <string name="all_power">Power</string>
    <string name="all_power_duration">20 minutes</string>
    <string name="all_power_description">Ideal for a boost in alertness and energy. This length limits you to the lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, making it easier to hit the ground running after waking up.</string>
    <string name="all_refresh">Refresh</string>
    <string name="all_refresh_duration">60 minutes</string>
    <string name="all_refresh_description">This nap is best for improvement in remembering facts, faces and names. It includes slow-wave sleep, the deepest type. The downside: some grogginess upon waking up.</string>
    <string name="all_recharge">Recharge</string>
    <string name="all_recharge_duration">90 minutes</string>
    <string name="all_recharge_description">This is a full cycle of sleep, meaning the lighter and deeper stages, including REM (Rapid Eye Movement). This leads to improved emotional and procedural memory and creativity. A nap of this length tipically avoids sleep inertia, making it easier to wake up.</string>
    <string name="all_coffee">Coffee</string>
    <string name="all_coffee_duration">20 minutes + Coffee</string>
    <string name="all_coffee_description">A quick coffee nap is an incredible way to boost energy and productivity. You drink a cup of your favorite coffee, then immediately take a snooze. That short nap will clear Adenosine (what makes you feel drowsy) from your brain for the caffeine to kick in. Like a welcome mat for your coffee.</string>
